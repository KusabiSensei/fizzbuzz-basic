# FizzBuzz - In BASIC

As part of a required test protocol, we are required to inform you that you
should be able to program the same identical program in multiple
implementation languages.

This one is BASIC, CBM v2 dialect. The core BASIC language was developed by
John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz at Dartmouth in 1964. BASIC was introduced to the
home computer market through the Apple ][, the TRS-80, and the Commodore PET,
using the interpreter for the MOS 6502 originally written by Bill Gates and
Paul Allen at Microsoft.
